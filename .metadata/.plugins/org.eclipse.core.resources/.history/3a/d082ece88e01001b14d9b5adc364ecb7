 * Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,

 * The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
 * 
 * You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree. 
 * You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, 
 * i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
